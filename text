Hi everyone, and welcome.
Today, I want to show you how AI can make your work easier, faster, and smarter—even if you’re not technical. Around the world, companies like Google, Microsoft, banks, hospitals, and governments follow the same best practices when introducing AI.
In the next few minutes, I’ll walk you through four simple but powerful ideas that will help you use AI confidently and safely.

1. What AI Can and Cannot Do (60 seconds)

Let’s start with the basics.

AI is a tool—not a brain.
Think of it like a super-smart assistant that can read, summarize, generate text, and analyze patterns. It can help you:

Draft emails and reports

Summarize long documents

Search for information

Create checklists or templates

Translate and simplify content

But AI has limits.
It doesn’t understand emotions, context, or intent the way humans do. It can make mistakes, misunderstand instructions, or present information with high confidence even when it’s wrong.
This is called a hallucination—and it’s normal.

So, AI will not replace your judgment.
Instead, think of AI as a supporting teammate that helps you do your work faster, while you stay in control.

2. Responsible & Safe Use of AI (75 seconds)

Around the world, responsible AI is built on three pillars: security, accuracy, and fairness.

First — Security.

Never paste sensitive data like:

customer information

account numbers

personal records

confidential documents

If you're unsure whether something is sensitive, always assume it is.

Second — Accuracy.

AI can be wrong. Always verify:

numbers

policies

procedures

critical details

A simple rule is “Trust but verify.”

Third — Fairness.

AI learns from data, and data can contain biases.
If AI output feels unfair, stereotypical, or inaccurate, do not use it as-is. Ask it to rephrase or adjust. And if anything seems off, raise it with your team.

One more thing — Human in the Loop.

AI should support decisions, not make final decisions on its own.
Human review is always required for final approvals.

This approach follows global frameworks like NIST AI RMF, EU AI Act, and standards used by top companies worldwide.

3. How to Use AI Effectively in Daily Work (70 seconds)

You don’t need to be technical to benefit from AI.
The real power comes from asking the right questions, which we call prompting.

Here are three simple prompting tips:

1. Be specific.

Instead of “write an email,” say:
“Draft a friendly reminder email to a customer about submitting their documents by Friday.”

2. Give context.

Tell AI who the message is for, why you're writing it, and what tone you want.

3. Ask AI to improve your work.

For example:

“Simplify this into 5 bullet points.”

“Make this more professional.”

“Summarize this PDF.”

“Create a checklist for this process.”

And always remember: AI gives you a first draft. You make the final call.

4. AI in Our Company — How You Should Use It (60 seconds)

Different companies have different rules, but the principles are the same everywhere.

Here’s what we expect:

Use approved AI tools only.

Don’t upload confidential data unless the tool is approved and secure.

Review all AI-generated work before sending it to customers or partners.

If something feels off, unsafe, or incorrect, stop and ask for guidance.

Here’s what AI means for you:

Less time on repetitive tasks

Better summaries and insights

Faster communication

More focus on meaningful, human-centered work

AI doesn’t replace you—it empowers you.

🎯 Closing (20 seconds)

AI is transforming workplaces everywhere, and you don’t need to be technical to take advantage of it.
Just remember:
Understand the tool, use it responsibly, verify what it produces, and follow our company guidelines.

Together, we can use AI safely, ethically, and productively.
