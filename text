AI Use Case Scoring Rubric (Enterprise Standard)

Score each dimension from 1 to 5.
Total Score determines Risk Tier.

Section A — Business Criticality (Weight: 20%)
Criterion	1 (Low)	3 (Medium)	5 (High)

🎯 Risk Tier Calculation
Step 1 → Score each criterion (1–5)

Multiply each section total by its weight:

A: Business Criticality × 0.20

B: Data Sensitivity × 0.20

C: Model Risk × 0.20

D: Ethical Risk × 0.15

E: Security Risk × 0.10

F: Operational Risk × 0.15

Step 2 → Add weighted scores

Final Score Range → Risk Tier:

Final Score	Tier	Required Oversight
1–2.0	Low Risk AI	Fast-track approval; architecture review only
2.1–3.5	Medium Risk AI	Requires AI Governance Review + Privacy Review
3.6–5.0	High Risk AI	Full AI Governance Board, Legal, Compliance, Model Risk Office review
