Purpose of the AI Education & Literacy Initiative

Objective

Establish a unified, company-wide baseline of AI literacy aligned with our enterprise AI roadmap.

Ensure all employees understand what constitutes AI Use Cases, AI-Assisted Use Cases, and appropriate governance expectations.

Mobilize the organization early to prevent capability gaps as AI adoption accelerates across the industry.

Why This Matters

AI is transforming operating models; without foundational literacy, teams risk misaligned development, duplication, and unmanaged risk.

Early education ensures employees can identify opportunities responsibly and reduces “shadow AI” usage.

Builds a culture of responsible innovation, enabling us to move faster and more confidently.

Ask

Approval to proceed with developing the enterprise-wide AI education module.

Purpose of Enterprise-Wide AI Maturity Survey

Objective

Establish a holistic baseline of AI maturity across the organization, covering technology, data, culture, governance, talent, and risk readiness.

Capture insights from all employees with role-based segmentation (e.g., leadership, managers, frontline, IT, data teams, business teams).

Provide a factual starting point for tracking progress year-over-year.

Why This Survey Is Critical

AI adoption is accelerating; without an initial benchmark, we cannot measure improvement or prioritize investments.

Enables leadership to identify where the organization stands today vs. where the industry is heading.

Reduces guesswork by replacing assumptions with structured, quantifiable insights.

Ask

Approval to proceed with designing and launching a company-wide AI Maturity Survey.


Scope & Design of the AI Maturity Survey

Survey Dimensions (McKinsey-Inspired Framework)

AI Strategy & Leadership Alignment

Technology Capability & Infrastructure Readiness

Data Quality, Accessibility & Governance

Talent, Skills & AI Literacy Levels

Operational Processes & Automation Readiness

Innovation Culture & Experimentation Mindset

Risk Management, Security & Responsible AI Controls

Survey Design Approach

Short, intuitive questionnaire accessible to all employees.

Role-based tagging to allow maturity mapping across departments and job levels.

Mix of quantitative scoring + qualitative insights to capture real adoption challenges.

Expected Outcomes

Clear baseline of current AI maturity by category, function, and role.

Identification of key gaps and opportunities for targeted interventions.

Foundation for a two-year AI roadmap with measurable KPIs and milestones.

Purpose of the Enterprise AI Hub

Objective

Establish a central AI community platform for employees to collaborate, share accomplishments, publish ideas, and exchange best practices.

Create a unified digital space to highlight AI use cases, success stories, lessons learned, and internal thought leadership.

Strengthen enterprise alignment by giving leadership visibility into AI activities across all business units.

Why This Is Needed Now

AI work is happening in pockets across the organization; without a central hub, efforts become siloed and duplicated.

A dedicated platform accelerates responsible innovation by enabling knowledge sharing and reducing rework.

Supports the company-wide AI initiative by promoting literacy, transparency, and cross-functional collaboration.



Operating Model & Value to Leadership

Operating Model

Managed by the AI Architecture team with light governance:

Tagging of content to approved categories (use case, blog, idea, help request).

Ensuring alignment with AI policies and terminology.

Periodic curation of featured content and success stories.

Open to all employees for posting, collaboration, and discussions.

Integrated with training, AI maturity initiatives, and future roadmap activities.

Value to Leadership

Visibility: Provides real-time insight into AI initiatives across the company.

Innovation: Crowdsources ideas from employees at all levels, unlocking high-value concepts early.

Efficiency: Reduces duplication of AI efforts across teams by centralizing knowledge and reusable components.

Governance: Ensures discussions and ideas remain aligned with enterprise AI standards without heavy control.

Culture Building: Encourages experimentation, continuous learning, and a community-driven AI culture.

AI Chatbot for Grant Application Support (Orange Team)

Objective

Deploy an AI-powered assistant to help Orange Team members and stakeholders fill out grant applications accurately and efficiently.

Use internal knowledge (successful past grants, FAQs, guidelines) to provide context-aware, tailored guidance during form completion.

How It Works (Concept)

Ingest and structure content from:

Previously successful grant applications

FAQ documents and internal guidance

Instruction PDFs, policy docs, and templates

AI chatbot guides users section-by-section:

Explains questions in plain language

Suggests structure/points to include (not final text)

Reminds users of mandatory fields, deadlines, and common pitfalls

Business Value

Increases quality and consistency of submissions.

Reduces time spent answering repetitive questions by the Orange Team.

Improves conversion/success rate of grant applications.


Design, Guardrails & Risk Management

Technical Approach

RAG-based (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot using:

Curated, approved internal documents only.

Metadata tagging by grant type, program, region, etc.

Two-layer LLM pattern:

Primary LLM: generates draft guidance based on retrieved content.

Secondary, smaller LLM (or rules engine) validates:

Alignment with original policy text.

No fabrication of rules, eligibility, or financial figures.

No completion of answers on behalf of the user where policy prohibits it.

Guardrails & Governance

Scope control: Chatbot restricted to grant-related topics only; redirects out-of-scope queries.

Source citation: Responses anchored to specific sections of FAQs / policies so users can verify.

Privacy & data protection:

No storage of sensitive personal data in prompts beyond session needs.

Redaction or masking of PII in logs where required.

Human-in-the-loop:

Clear escalation path: “Contact Orange Team” when confidence is low or policy conflict detected.

Auditability:

Logging of key interactions for quality review and continuous improvement.

Enterprise Guardrails

Privacy & PII Protection:

Automated masking of sensitive info in transcript data.

Restricted access based on role (supervisors, QA, leadership only).

Two-Layer Model Validation:

Primary LLM generates insights.

Secondary small LLM/rules engine validates accuracy, bans hallucinations, and ensures alignment with call text.

AI Case Closure Agent for CRM: Automating “No Further Action Needed” Emails

Objective

Deploy an AI agent that reviews incoming CRM emails and automatically closes cases when the customer has completed their action and no further response is required.

Reduce operational workload by eliminating manual case review for emails that contain confirmation statements, attachments sent, or final acknowledgments.

How It Works

Customer sends an email with phrases like:

“Attached is the document”

“Here is what you requested”

“I have submitted everything”

“Thanks, no further questions”

Attachment goes to Kofax, but the email remains in CRM.

AI agent performs:

Email content analysis

Attachment confirmation check (via metadata/Kofax link)

Intent classification: no questions, no requests, no new tasks

Automatic closure of the case only if criteria are fully met.

Business Value

Eliminates high-volume, low-value manual case closure work.

Improves SLA by reducing open case backlog.

Enables agents to focus on complex cases requiring human judgment.

Guardrails, Safety Controls & Exception Handling

Conservative Automation Strategy

AI only closes when confidence is 100% clear that no action is required.

Any ambiguity → do not close and leave for manual review.

Secondary classifier checks for:

Questions (“what should I…?”, “can you…?”, “when will…?”)

Requests (“please update…”, “I need…”)

Missing documents or unclear statements

Conflicting or multi-part emails

Guardrails & Governance

Two-layer validation:

Primary LLM determines customer intent.

Secondary small LLM/rules engine cross-verifies “no action required.”

Attachment Verification:

Confirm attachment metadata in Kofax before closure.

If attachment not found → do not close.

Audit Logs:

Every auto-closure logged with rationale, model confidence, referenced email lines.

Exception Routing:

Emails with questions or new requests routed to the appropriate team queue.

Safe Failure Mode:

On uncertainty, the system defaults to human review, avoiding incorrect closures.
